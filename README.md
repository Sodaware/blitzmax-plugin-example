BlitzMax Plugin System Demo (Windows Version)
=============================================

This repo is the accompaniment for this article:
http://sodaware.sdf.org/blitzmax-plugin-system-win32/
 
It contains code for a very simple plugin system using BlitzMax and dynamic
libraries.

Run "build.bat" to compile the test application ("plugin_system.exe") and both
plugins. This will also create a "plugins" directory and copy the dll files to
it.

See [this post](http://sodaware.sdf.org/blitzmax-plugin-system-win32/) for a
full breakdown of how it works.
